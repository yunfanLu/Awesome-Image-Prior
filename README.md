## 1.1 Regularization

### 1.1.1 Total Variation Regularization

**Definition:** Total variation regularization or total variation filtering, is a noise removal process (filter). It is based on the principle that signals with excessive and possibly spurious detail have high total variation, that is, the integral of the absolute image gradient is high.
